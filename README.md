There are a lot of tutorials online that show how to set a price alert. For instance set the price alert to $20. If price is equal or smaller than $20 send an email. The willingness to pay a certain amount for a product is subjective, though. For Person A $20 might be a good price for person B $25 might be a good price. Such decisions are not or vaguely at max based on the past prices of a product.

This project consists of the followin:
1. A skript to get amazon price data save them in a mysql database
2. A skript that pulls this data from the database and decides if values of the time series are significantly low/high
